# Sentiment-Analysis-
Sentiment analysis of tweets using stanford's NLP

The java files can be found in src

This application also removes URLS, hashtags and usernames from the tweets before sending it to the NLP(Natural Language Processing)

I was not able to upload it to appengine as stanford's NLP is not compatible with appengine(NLP requires JDK 1.8 and appengine requires JDK 1.7)
